# Z39.50 Analysis

Webhooks for Z39.50 projects should be sent to

``` http
POST /libcrowds/analysis/z3950
```

All task runs are compared looking a match rate of at least 70% for the answer
keys oclc and shelfmark (disregarding task runs where all answer fields have
been left blank).

If a match is found the result associated with the task is updated to the
matched answer for each key and analysis_complete will be set to True.

If all keys for all answers have been left blank the result will be set to the
empty string for each key and analysis_complete will be set to True.

For all other cases the result will be set to the empty string for each key and
analysis_complete will be set to False. These are the results that will have to
be checked manually, after which analysis_complete should be set to True.
