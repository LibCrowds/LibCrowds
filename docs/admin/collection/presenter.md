# Task Presenter

The task presenter is the view via which the microsite's users contribute to tasks. For example, LibCrowds Viewer is one
of the available taks presenters that deals with the collection of Web Annotations for IIIF content.

Each type of task presenter provides a selection of configuration options that can be set at the collection microsite
level. These options will be applied to all projects within the microsite.
