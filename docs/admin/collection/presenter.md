# Task Presenter

The task presenter is the component via which the microsite's users contribute
to tasks. For example, LibCrowds Viewer is one of the available taks presenters
that deals with the collection of Web Annotations for IIIF content.

Each type of task presenter provides a selection of configuration options that
can be set at the collection microsite level. These options will be applied to
all projects within the microsite.

The first options shown on the page is the 'Presenter Type', followed by the
available options for the selected presenter type, which are described in
further detail below.
