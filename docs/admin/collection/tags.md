# Tags

Tags are used to help users more easily location the types of project that
they're interested in. The available tags for all projects within a collection
are managed via this section.

![Collection Admin - Tags](/assets/admin-collection-tags.png?raw=true)

For each tag type created a new filter will be added to
the  collection's main projects page page (shown on the left in the screenshot
below).

## Creating

To add a new tag click the 'Add a tag type' button at the top of the page. A
modal will appear containing options to name the tag type (e.g. Location),
choose a colour and set an initial list of tags for the new type (e.g. London,
Plymouth etc.).

## Updating

Tag types can be edited or removed by locating them in the table and clicking
the 'Edit' or 'Remove' buttons, respectively.
