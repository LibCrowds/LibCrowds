# Tags

Tags are used to help users more easily location the types of project that
they're interested in. For each tag type created a new filter will
be added to the microsite's main projects page page.

The available tags for a project are managed at a collection level, via this
section. These tags can then be added to each project via the
[Project Admin](admin/project.md) section.

To add a new tag click the 'Add a tag type' button at the top of the table. A
modal will appear containing options to name the tag type (e.g. Location),
choose a colour and set an initial list of tags that belong to that type
(e.g. London, Plymouth etc.).

Tags can be edited or removed by locating them in the table and clicking the
'Edit' or 'Remove' buttons, respectively.
