# Tags

Tags are used to help users more easily location the types of project within a
collection that they're interested in. For each tag type created via this
admin section a new filter will be added to the microsite's Contribute
page (among others).

![Collection Admin - Tags](../assets/admin-collection-tags.png?raw=true)

To add a new tag click the 'Add tag' button at the top of the table. You
will then be given options to choose a tag type (e.g. Location), a tag name
(e.g. London) and a colour. Note that the colour applies to all tags of the
same type.

Once tags are created they can be added to individual projects via the
[Project Admin](admin/project.md) section.

Tags can be edited or removed by locating them in the table and clicking the
corresponding buttons. If you want to edit the color for a particular tag type
just click edit on any tags of that type.
