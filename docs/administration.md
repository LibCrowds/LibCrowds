The page also provides a list of currently featured projects.

## Collections

Categories for all microsites are created via the **New Category** section and edited or deleted via the **Current Categories** section.

### Tags

Tags are used to organise projects and filter projects by multiple criteria. For
example, a project can be tagged with the location *London* and task type
*Transcription*, allowing user's to filter all projects that contain
transcription tasks related to London.

Each tag is given a **name** and a **type**. For each unique type, a
multi-select sorting field will be made available alongside the lists of
projects presented to users.

## Users

To manage user administrator rights, search for the user by name and click the **Grant admin rights** or **Revoke admin rights** buttons.

To download all user data click the **Export to CSV** or **Export to JSON** buttons.
